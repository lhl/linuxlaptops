Reviews and Benchmarks are here:

* [2024 MSI Prestige 13 AI+ EVO A2VM](https://github.com/lhl/linuxlaptops/wiki/2024-MSI-Prestige-13-AI--Evo-A2VM)
* [2023 Minisforum UM790 Pro](https://github.com/lhl/linuxlaptops/wiki/Minisforum-UM790-Pro) - this is a 7940HS minipc, not a laptop, but it's a similar style review to my earlier reviews and for those interested in how mobile Zen4 (Phoenix Point) compares to the prior systems, may be of interest!
* [2022 Framework Laptop DIY Edition 12th Gen Intel Batch 1](https://github.com/lhl/linuxlaptops/wiki/2022-Framework-Laptop-DIY-Edition-12th-Gen-Intel-Batch-1) - a comprehensive review of the 2nd-gen Framework 13 (Intel 12th gen) laptop, w/ a lot of focus on battery performance tuning.
* [2020 MECHREVO Code 01 PF5NU1G](https://github.com/lhl/linuxlaptops/wiki/2020-MECHREVO-Code-01-PF5NU1G) - I got unreasonably excited  about getting this laptop (sourced from retail in China) and really dug into it
